# ADVENT OF CODE 2032

Hey, this is what I've done for the 2023 edition of the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

Using ts as always, just run the index.ts file, don't forget to set the `DAY` and `PUZZLE` value.
Also change the input in input.ts

Let's see if I'm going farther than the last two years this time!
